# small stories
digital media design final project

### Beta Review
- Populated STRIPS planner with a rich domain and a problem (initial state and goal state). The story world centers on a tabby cat. The story reaches the `END` state when the cat dies, falls in love, or goes to sleep. The planner outputs a sequence of steps. 
- Implemented templates to translate the STRIPS planner steps into grammatically-correct sentences. There are options for verb tenses: past, present, future.
- Set up global environment variables that dictate the following: protagonist's name, setting/city
- Successfully output a unique short story per page load about a tabby cat!
- Further work: incorporate details related to the setting throughout the story, automatic pronoun replacement of proper nouns, (tentative) art asset development for the story that can be swapped in and out based on the story that is generated

### Alpha Review
- Set up the STRIPS (Stanford Research Institute Problem Solver) planner with a basic example of a birthday dinner.
- Set up a web development environment with Next.js, which will be where the graphical output of the procedurally-generated story will live.
